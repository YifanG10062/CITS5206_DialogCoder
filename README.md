# CITS5206_DialogCoder

## Problem Statement: What Are We Building and Why?

### Overview
Researchers analyzing submarine simulator team exercises face a labor-intensive challenge. Each one-hour voice recording is transcribed into a CSV file containing 400â€“500 dialogue rows, which must be manually coded by two independent raters. This manual process is slow, prone to error, and not scalable as the volume of data increases.

### The Current Challenge
- **Time-Intensive Process:** Manually coding extensive transcripts takes hours per file.
- **Human Error and Inconsistency:** Repetitive tasks lead to potential mistakes and varying interpretations.
- **Scalability Issues:** As data volume grows, the manual method becomes increasingly unmanageable.
- **Coder Fatigue:** Monotonous work increases the likelihood of oversight and reduces overall accuracy.

### Why the Client Wants This Software
The client is seeking a solution that transforms a repetitive, error-prone manual process into an efficient, automated workflow. By leveraging a user-defined dictionary of keywords and phrases, the software will:
- **Reduce Processing Time:** Automate coding to turn hours of work into minutes.
- **Ensure Consistency:** Apply a predefined qualitative coding frame uniformly across all transcripts.
- **Support Scalability:** Handle bulk uploads of transcripts, making it feasible to process large datasets.
- **Enhance Data Security:** Operate entirely offline to ensure sensitive information remains secure.
- **Improve Resource Allocation:** Allow researchers to focus on higher-value analysis rather than manual coding tasks.

### Key Deliverables for the MVP
1. **Automated Transcript Coding:**  
   - Process CSV transcripts by mapping each dialogue row to a communication category based on a user-defined keyword dictionary.
   - Append a new column to each CSV file with the assigned code.

2. **Bulk Data Processing:**  
   - Enable simultaneous processing of multiple CSV files to efficiently handle large volumes of data.

3. **Frequency Summary Report:**  
   - Generate summary reports that provide frequency counts for each communication code across the dataset.

4. **Offline Operation:**  
   - Ensure the application functions entirely offline, keeping all sensitive data secure and eliminating dependency on external services.
