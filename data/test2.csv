Sonar holds two new contacts. Merchant bearing 108 designated Sierra 1 and Merchant bearing 324 designated Sierra 2.
All stations this is Track Manager. Please prioritise Sierra 1 as it appears substantially closer based upon its acoustic strength.
Roger Track Manager; prioritising Sierra 1.
"Roger, Track Manager. Raising periscope."
"All stations, I confirm Sierra 1 is a merchant well within visual range. Getting range estimate now."
Roger Optix. Sierra 1 within visual range. TMA please reduce range of Sierra 1 to around 10 kiloyards and limit speed to no more than 15 knots.
Roger Track Manager. Sierra 1 range reduced to 10 kiloyards. Finding solution now.
Thank you TMA.
"Track Manager, sending through range estimate of Sierra 1 now. Estimated range 6.12 kiloyards with an ATB of 90 Port."
"Thank you Optix. Fusing data now. TMA, Sierra 1 is now designated Foxtrot 1 with initial range and ATB estimates."
Thank you Track Manager. Received in good order.
"All stations, new solution for Foxtrot 1 entered."
"Thank you TMA. Solution looks good. Please work on Sierra 2. Optix, is Sierra 2 within visual range."
"Negative Track Manager. S2 beyond visual range, somewhere between 19 and 30 kiloyards."
"All stations, entering initial solution for Sierra 2 now."
Thank you TMA. Solution looks good.
"Optix, this is Track Manager. Solution for Sierra 2 is beginning to lag. Recommend decreasing range somewhere between 19 and 27 kiloyards."
"All stations, the tips of Sierra 2 are starting to emerge on the horizon. Entering new range estimate of 19 kiloyards."
"Roger, thank you Optix. Update received. Reducing range of Foxtrot 2 to 19 kiloyards."
"All stations, updating solution for Foxtrot 2 now."
"Good work, TMA. Bearing rates now match for Foxtrot 2."
